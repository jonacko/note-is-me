## 1. Summary

This project was undertaken as a submission for a Birmingham University Bootcamp assignment, with a brief to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.  The user story and acceptance criteria is as follows:

## 2. Key features:

- button on landing page redirects to notes page
- when a note is entered and the save button clicked, the note saves to db.json file as an object
- the note appears in the saved notes section of the page
- when the delete button on a saved note is clicked, not is deleted from the page and the db.json file
- each note is assigned with a unique ID using npm's UUID
- applicated deployed using Heroku


## 3. Issues encountered/further amendments

As far as I understand, all acceptance criteria are met.  However if I were to develop this readme generator further, I would add the following features:

- make page responsive to click to automatically detelt content and write over a new note (as opposed to needing to click on top note)
- create preview drop-down function in saved notes
